# EMG Feature Robustness Under Fatigue

Surface Electromyography (sEMG) based gesture classification systems often degrade under muscle fatigue. This project investigates the robustness of different EMG feature domains under fatigue conditions.

The study evaluates how models trained on non-fatigued data generalize to:

* Non-fatigued test data
* Fatigued test data

The goal is to understand which feature domains are more resistant to fatigue-induced signal changes.
